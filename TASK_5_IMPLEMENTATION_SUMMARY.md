# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Detailed Health Check Endpoint

## Task Description

Implement a detailed health check endpoint (`/health/detailed`) for the prediction API that provides comprehensive information about:
- Environment versions (NumPy, scikit-learn, joblib)

## Endpoint Specification

### Request
```
GET /health/detailed
```

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "status": "healthy" | "degraded" | "error",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "version": "6.0.0",
  "environment": {
    "numpy_version": "string",
    "sklearn_version": "string",
    "joblib_version": "string"
  },
  "models": {
    "total_loaded": integer,
    "locations": integer,
    "by_location": {
      "location_name": {
        "algorithms": ["algorithm1", "algorithm2", ...],
        "count": integer
      }
    },
    "fallback_mode": boolean
  },
  "components": {
    "api_manager": "ready" | "unavailable",
    "gee_client": "ready" | "unavailable",
    "weather_client": "ready" | "unavailable",
    "variety_db": "ready" | "unavailable",
    "sowing_intelligence": "ready" | "unavailable"
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Environment Version Reporting
- Reports NumPy version (critical for model compatibility)
- Reports scikit-learn version (critical for model compatibility)
- Reports joblib version (used for model serialization)

### 2. Model Loading Status
- **total_loaded**: Total number of models successfully loaded
- **locations**: Number of locations with loaded models
- **by_location**: Detailed breakdown showing:
  - Which algorithms are available per location
  - Count of models per location
- **fallback_mode**: Boolean indicating if service is using fallback models

### 3. Service Status Determination
The endpoint intelligently determines service status:

- **"healthy"**: 
  - Models are loaded
  - Not in fallback mode
  - All components operational

- **"degraded"**:
  - No models loaded, OR
  - Running in fallback mode (using simple regression models)
  - Service continues to operate but with reduced accuracy

- **"error"**:
  - Health check itself failed
  - Returns error details

### 4. Fallback Mode Detection
The endpoint detects fallback mode by checking if:
- Model paths contain "fallback"
- Model timestamps contain "fallback"
- No models are loaded (total_models == 0)

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies **Requirement 3.4** from the specification:

> **Requirement 3.4:** WHEN the API health check is called THEN it SHALL report the number of successfully loaded models and any compatibility issues

### Verification:
✅ Reports number of successfully loaded models (`total_loaded`)  
✅ Reports compatibility information (environment versions)  
✅ Reports model breakdown by location  
✅ Indicates fallback mode (compatibility issue indicator)  
✅ Provides overall service status  

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python src/prediction_api.py
   ```

2. Test the endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health/detailed
   ```

### Automated Testing
Run the provided test script:
```bash
python test_detailed_health_endpoint.py
```

The test script will:
- Verify endpoint accessibility
- Validate response structure
- Check all required fields are present
- Compare with basic health endpoint
- Display detailed results

## Usage Examples

### Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/health/detailed")
data = response.json()

if data['status'] == 'healthy':
    print(f"✅ Service healthy with {data['models']['total_loaded']} models")
elif data['status'] == 'degraded':
    print(f"⚠️ Service degraded - fallback mode: {data['models']['fallback_mode']}")
```

### cURL
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health/detailed | jq .
```

### Monitoring Script
```bash
# Check if service is healthy
STATUS=$(curl -s http://localhost:8000/health/detailed | jq -r '.status')
if [ "$STATUS" != "healthy" ]; then
    echo "Alert: Service status is $STATUS"
fi
```

## Integration with Existing Code

The endpoint integrates seamlessly with existing code:

1. **Uses existing service instance**: `prediction_service`
2. **Accesses existing model data**: `prediction_service.location_models`
3. **Follows existing patterns**: Similar structure to `/health` endpoint
4. **No breaking changes**: Additive only, doesn't modify existing endpoints

## Error Handling

The endpoint includes comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    # Main health check logic
    ...
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Detailed health check failed: {e}")
    return {
        'status': 'error',
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'error': str(e)
    }
```

This ensures the endpoint always returns a valid response, even if internal checks fail.

## Benefits

1. **Operational Visibility**: Provides detailed insight into service health
2. **Debugging Aid**: Environment versions help diagnose compatibility issues
3. **Monitoring Ready**: Structured data suitable for automated monitoring
4. **Proactive Alerts**: Fallback mode detection enables early warning
5. **Deployment Validation**: Verify model loading after deployments

## Next Steps

After this implementation:

1. ✅ Task 5 is complete
2. Next task: Task 6 - Backup existing models and retrain with current dependencies
3. The detailed health endpoint will be used to verify successful model loading in Task 8

## Documentation

Complete documentation is available in:
- **DETAILED_HEALTH_ENDPOINT.md**: Full endpoint documentation
- **test_detailed_health_endpoint.py**: Test script with examples
- **src/prediction_api.py**: Inline code documentation

## Verification Checklist
