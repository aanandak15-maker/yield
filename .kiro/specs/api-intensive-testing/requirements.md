# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive intensive testing framework for the Crop Yield Prediction API. The goal is to ensure the API is production-ready by validating its reliability, performance, security, and correctness under various conditions including normal operations, edge cases, high load scenarios, and failure conditions. The testing framework will cover all endpoints, validate data integrity, test error handling, measure performance metrics, and ensure the API can handle concurrent requests while maintaining accuracy and stability.
