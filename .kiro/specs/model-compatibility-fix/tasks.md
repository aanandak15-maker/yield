# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update dependency specifications in requirements.txt
  - Update NumPy to version 2.3.3 or compatible 2.x range
  - Update scikit-learn to version 1.7.2 or compatible 1.7.x range
  - Update joblib to version 1.5.2 or compatible 1.5.x range
  - Remove or update XGBoost version constraint if present
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Enhance model training script with environment logging
  - Add `_log_environment_info()` method to log NumPy, scikit-learn, and joblib versions at training start
  - Update `_save_model()` method to include environment metadata (library versions) in saved model data
  - Use joblib protocol 5 for better NumPy 2.x compatibility when saving models
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Create model validation comparison script
  - Create new script `validate_model_performance.py` to compare old vs new model metrics
  - Load original model metrics from `model_results/training_summary.json`
  - Calculate performance deltas (R², MAE, RMSE) between original and retrained models
  - Generate validation report showing which models meet the 5% threshold
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Enhance model loading with environment compatibility checks
  - Add `_log_runtime_environment()` method to log current library versions at API startup
  - Add `_check_environment_compatibility()` method to validate NumPy >= 2.0 and scikit-learn >= 1.7
  - Add `_validate_model_structure()` method to check loaded models have required keys
  - Update `_load_models()` to call compatibility checks before loading and track failed models with specific error types
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Implement detailed health check endpoint
  - Add new `/health/detailed` GET endpoint to prediction API
  - Return environment versions (NumPy, scikit-learn, joblib)
  - Return model loading status (total loaded, by location, fallback mode indicator)
  - Return overall service status ('healthy' or 'degraded')
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [x] 6. Backup existing models and retrain with current dependencies
  - Create `models_backup/` directory and copy all existing .pkl files
  - Install updated dependencies from requirements.txt
  - Run `model_trainer.py` to retrain all models with NumPy 2.x and scikit-learn 1.7.x
  - Verify all 15 model files (5 locations × 3 algorithms) are created in models/ directory
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 7. Validate retrained model performance
  - Run `validate_model_performance.py` to compare old vs new models
  - Review validation report to ensure all models meet 5% performance threshold
  - Document any models that don't meet threshold and investigate causes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 8. Test API startup with new models
  - Start the prediction API with newly trained models
  - Verify logs show "✅ Successfully loaded model" for all 15 models without NumPy compatibility warnings
  - Call `/health/detailed` endpoint and verify all models are loaded
  - Verify no fallback mode is active
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.4_

- [x] 9. Execute end-to-end prediction tests
  - Make test prediction request with sample data (Rice, Bhopal, valid sowing date)
  - Verify prediction response is valid with yield value, confidence score, and model metadata
  - Verify response includes new model timestamp (not fallback)
  - Test predictions for all 5 locations to ensure coverage
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 10. Create deployment documentation
  - Document the complete retraining and deployment process
  - Include rollback procedure with specific commands
  - Document monitoring checklist for post-deployment
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
