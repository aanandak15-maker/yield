## Key Features

### 1. Concurrent Request Handling
- Uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel execution
- Configurable worker pool sizes (10, 50, 100)
- Proper exception handling and error tracking

### 2. Performance Metrics Collection
- Integrates with `PerformanceMetrics` utility class
- Records response times, status codes, error messages
- Calculates comprehensive statistics:
  - Min, max, average, median response times
  - Standard deviation
  - Percentiles: p50, p75, p90, p95, p99
  - Throughput (requests per second)
  - Error rates

### 3. Configurable Thresholds
All thresholds are loaded from `test_config.json`:
- `max_response_time_ms`: 5000ms (single request)
- `max_response_time_under_load_ms`: 10000ms (concurrent requests)
- `max_p95_response_time_ms`: 7000ms
- `max_p99_response_time_ms`: 10000ms

### 4. Detailed Reporting
Each test prints comprehensive statistics:
```
✓ 50 concurrent requests completed
  Success rate: 98.0%
  Average response time: 3245.67ms
  Min: 1234.56ms
  Max: 8765.43ms
  Median: 3012.34ms
  P95: 6543.21ms
  P99: 7890.12ms
  Throughput: 15.42 req/s
```

### 5. Test Markers
- `@pytest.mark.performance`: All performance tests
- `@pytest.mark.critical`: Critical tests that must pass
- `@pytest.mark.slow`: Tests that take longer (100 concurrent)

## Test Data Generation

### Request Diversity
Tests use diverse request data:
- Multiple crop types (Rice, Wheat, Maize)
- Multiple locations (Bhopal, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Patna, etc.)
- Mix of requests with/without variety specification
- Valid sowing dates (30-180 days ago)

### Location Coverage
Tests cover all North India regions:
- Madhya Pradesh (Bhopal)
- Uttar Pradesh (Lucknow, Varanasi)
- Punjab (Chandigarh, Amritsar)
- Bihar (Patna)
- Haryana (Hisar)
- Rajasthan (Jaipur)

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 4.1: Single Request Response Time ✓
- `test_single_request_response_time`: Validates < 5 seconds
- `test_response_time_percentiles`: Measures detailed percentiles

### Requirement 4.2: 10 Concurrent Requests ✓
- `test_10_concurrent_requests`: All requests succeed without errors
- Validates response structure and timing

### Requirement 4.3: 50 Concurrent Requests ✓
- `test_50_concurrent_requests`: Response times < 10 seconds
- Allows minimal failure rate (< 5%)

### Requirement 4.4: 100 Concurrent Requests ✓

## Running the Tests

### Run All Performance Tests
```bash
cd test_api_intensive
pytest suites/test_performance.py -v
```

### Run Specific Test Class
```bash
pytest suites/test_performance.py::TestResponseTime -v
```

### Run Single Test
```bash
pytest suites/test_performance.py::TestResponseTime::test_single_request_response_time -v
```

### Run Without Slow Tests
```bash
pytest suites/test_performance.py -v -m "not slow"
```

### Run With Detailed Output
```bash
pytest suites/test_performance.py -v -s
```

## Prerequisites

### 1. API Must Be Running
The API must be running on the configured base URL (default: http://localhost:8000)

Start the API:
```bash
python run_api.py
```

### 2. API Authentication (Optional)
For full functionality, configure:
- Google Earth Engine credentials (for real-time satellite data)
- OpenWeather API key (for weather data)

However, tests can run with mock/fallback data if external services are unavailable.

### 3. Database
Ensure the variety database is accessible at the configured path.

## Performance Expectations

### Typical Results (Local Development)
- Single request: 2000-4000ms
- 10 concurrent: avg 2500-4500ms
- 50 concurrent: avg 3000-6000ms, p95 < 7000ms
- 100 concurrent: avg 3500-7000ms, p99 < 10000ms
- Throughput: 10-20 req/s

### Production Environment
Performance may vary based on:
- Server resources (CPU, memory)
- Network latency
- External API response times (GEE, OpenWeather)
- Database query performance
- Model loading and prediction time

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
Tests handle various error scenarios:
- Connection failures
- Timeouts
- Server errors (5xx)
- Client errors (4xx)
- External service failures

### Metrics Collection
Even failed requests are tracked:
- Error messages recorded
- Response times measured
- Status codes logged
- Error rates calculated

## Integration with CI/CD

### Test Execution
Tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
```yaml
- name: Run Performance Tests
  run: |
    cd test_api_intensive
    pytest suites/test_performance.py -v --html=reports/performance_report.html
```

### Performance Regression Detection
Compare metrics across runs to detect regressions:
- Response time increases
- Throughput decreases
- Error rate increases

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Load Testing with Locust**: Implement sustained load tests (Task 7.2)
2. **Variety Selection Performance**: Measure database query times (Task 7.3)
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, disk I/O during tests
4. **Historical Tracking**: Store metrics over time for trend analysis
5. **Performance Baselines**: Establish and enforce performance baselines
6. **Distributed Testing**: Run tests from multiple geographic locations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Tests fail with "Connection refused"
- **Solution**: Ensure API is running on http://localhost:8000

**Issue**: Tests fail with "GEE authentication failed"
- **Solution**: Configure GEE credentials or tests will use fallback data

**Issue**: Response times exceed thresholds
- **Solution**: Check server resources, external API latency, database performance

**Issue**: High error rates under load
- **Solution**: Increase server resources, optimize database queries, add caching

## Metrics Export

### JSON Export
```python
metrics_collector.export_to_file("performance_metrics.json", format="json")
```

### CSV Export
```python
metrics_collector.export_to_file("performance_metrics.csv", format="csv")
